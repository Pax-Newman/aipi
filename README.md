# aipi
A small general purpose API for AI/ML applications.

## Planned features

 - [ ] Sentence embeddings with SentenceTransformers
 - [ ] CLIP image/text embeddings
 - [ ] Local LLM inference with Llamacpp
   - Generally works but there seems to be a bug when trying to use it in place of OpenAI's API
 - [X] Config file to define model paths
