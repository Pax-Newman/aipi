# aipi
A small general purpose flexible API for AI/ML applications.

## To Do

 - [ ] Local LLM inference with Llamacpp
   - Chat endpoint works but there seems to be a bug when trying to use it in place of OpenAI's API
   - Regular (Non-chat) completion endpoint needs to be added
 - [ ] Config file to define model paths
   - Model definitions in the config works, but currently the config path is hardcoded
 - [ ] Add documentation for adding new model types
